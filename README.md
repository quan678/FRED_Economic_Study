This research project leverages the comprehensive economic data available through the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) database to 
analyze key aspects of the USA economy. My aim is to provide a detailed exploration with these three critical economic indicators: Gross Domestic Product (GDP), unemployment rates, 
and international trade figures. By dissecting these metrics, I seek to offer insights into the economic health and trends of the nation and comprehension of complex economic dynamics.
This project involves the use of Python and FRED API to pull the economic data, which is then processed with the Pandas library to ensure clean datasets for later analytics. 
The project applies advanced data analysis techniques, leveraging Pythonâ€™s tools for statistical evaluation and correlational modeling. 
Results are presented through visualizations crafted with Plotly and Matplotlib, enhancing data interpretation. 
This technical framework provides a comprehensive basis for insightful, actionable analysis of key economic trends.
